# Ref — scaling human design mastery with AI-extras

### What is Ref?
**Ref** is the first platform that turns the hard-won knowledge of leading designers into on-demand **AI-extras**—autonomous, expert-level agents that behave like virtual co-workers. Any creative can hire, use, or embed these agents directly inside their workflow, getting contextual, professional feedback 24 / 7.

### How it works
1. **Capture expert knowledge**  
   Designers import raw assets—notes, talks, slide decks, Figma files—into a private “expert wiki” that preserves nuance and voice.  

2. **Train an AI-extra**  
   The wiki is distilled into a custom language-model checkpoint, creating an agent that mirrors the expert’s taste, methodology, and decision logic.  

3. **Deploy everywhere**  
   AI-extras can be used as a chat sidebar in design tools, integrated via API, or listed on Ref’s open marketplace so others can use them on demand.  

4. **Continuous refinement**  
   Every interaction (opt-in) becomes new training data, so the agent improves while the expert retains full oversight and can roll back or tweak outputs at any time.

### Vision
Ref imagines a future where elite design judgment is no longer scarce. By packaging craft knowledge as AI co-workers, the platform aims to:

- **Democratize excellence** — make top-tier critiques, concepts, and best practices instantly accessible to every project, regardless of budget or location.  
- **Multiply impact** — let experts mentor thousands simultaneously without burning out, while preserving their unique voice and standards.  
- **Build a data moat for creative work** — aggregate the world’s rare, tacit design know-how into a continually evolving corpus that future agents can learn from.

### Key benefits for designers and teams
- **Always-on sparring partner** for color accessibility checks, UX critiques, brand consistency, and concept ideation.  
- **Context-aware answers** grounded in real project artifacts rather than generic web data.  
- **Seamless collaboration**—hand-off annotated drafts, receive guided revisions, and iterate faster.  
- **Marketplace discovery**—find niche specialists (calligraphy, motion, service design, etc.) and plug them into your tool stack within minutes.  

### Typical use cases
| Scenario | How an AI-extra helps |
|----------|-----------------------|
| Early-stage brand exploration | Generates mood boards aligned to a defined strategy, then critiques them against market positioning. |
| Accessibility audit | Scans a Figma file for contrast issues and proposes WCAG-compliant palettes with rationale. |
| Product-design feedback loop | Joins daily Slack threads, pointing out interaction snags, copy-tone mismatches, or flow inconsistencies. |
| Community education | Hosts live “office hours,” answering subscriber questions with the same depth as the expert designer. |

### Why it matters now
Generative AI is evolving from isolated text assistants to **domain-specific agents** that understand context and take action. Ref bridges that gap for design, blending human taste with machine availability to raise the baseline quality of digital experiences worldwide.
