# Copy Page for LLM

**AI can’t convert what it can’t read.**

## What it does

A one-line component that adds a “Copy for LLM” button to your site and outputs clean, structured Markdown.  
It makes your content readable for any LLM or agent—without UI noise or irrelevant layout data.

## Why it matters

Most users already paste your page into ChatGPT. But they do it manually.  
It's noisy, error-prone, and out of your control.  
At the same time, AI agents are starting to browse your site directly.  
Soon, they’ll buy from your site—for real customers.

**If your page isn’t LLM-readable, you’re invisible.**

## Mission

We're building the UX layer for the agent-first web.  
A future where your site is not just beautiful for humans, but understandable to AI.  
This component gives you control over what LLMs “see”—and ensures your message gets delivered clearly.

## Benefits

- Makes your page LLM-readable
- Adds a “Copy for LLM” button automatically
- Outputs clean Markdown optimized for parsing
- Lets you define what LLMs extract
- Zero friction: one line of code

## How it works

1. Add our component to your site (one line of code).
2. A button appears: “Copy Page for LLM”
3. Behind the scenes, your page is transformed into structured Markdown:
   - Only relevant content (titles, descriptions, pricing, CTA)
   - No layout or extra UI junk
4. When users click the button or LLMs crawl your site, they get the clean Markdown.
5. This improves AI summarization, retrieval, and agent execution on your content.
